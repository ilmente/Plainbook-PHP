Plainbook CMS
=============

*A place for writers*

# The CMS
This is a simple and markdown flat-file CMS written in PHP. 
Yes, I know: another CMS, another instrument for manage contents of the web, bla bla bla...
I perfectly know, but I chose to develop it for one reason: I want something simple and powerful at the same time, that gives the designer the possibility to do almost everything he wants, and let the writer composes freely and manage the pages as simple files. No logins, no codes, no learning curves: just a folder and some markdown files.


Try it, but remember that this CMS is still in alpha: I need to test it more and I have to write the whole documentation. So, if you'll decide to *join the pleasure* of **Plainbook**, please give me a feedback every time you find something wrong, or perfectible.
Thanks.

## How it works
Copy the project in your server root folder, edit the `pb-config.php`, put an `index.md` file inside the `pb-contents` folder and you're ready to go!


# Versions
* 0.9 alpha: main core of the cms;
* **1.0.0 alpha**: routing, sorting system, tags, file visibility, bugfixes;
 

# Requirements
You only need a server with PHP 5.3+. Nothing more.
