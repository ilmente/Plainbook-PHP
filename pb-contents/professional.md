# web and frontend developer

You can find out more detailed informations about my work on [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ilmente) and on my [online CV](http://cv.ilmente.it).
I began as an asp.net developer in 2005, almost on backend systems. After a while, I started my adventure as a freelance, designing web sites. This experience taught me a few things:

	<ul class="i-think-that">
		<li>windows systems cost a lot</li>
		<li>open source community is made up of good guys</li>
		<li>wordpress covered the 70% of my customers needs</li>
		<li>photoshop is a designer-best-friend-forever</li>
		<li>I do love client-side coding</li>
	</ul>

I decided to learn php a little bit more and I totally discoveredjquery and ajax potential, expecially if mixed with html5 and css3. I've never been a pure art director, and I never will, but I developed my passion for ui and ux studying client-side technologies.
Now I'm using the experience achieved in these years also developing mobile hybrid apps with phonegap/meap platforms. At least, I am:

	(function($, ilmente){
		var iam = "a web developer of kindly web services" +
			"and advanced javascript web apps";
			
		iam += "a frontend developer with a huge curiosity" +
			"for design and usability";
			
		iam += "a mobile hybrid apps developer who loves minimal" +
			"elegant and functional interfaces";
			
		iam += "a student of organizational behaviours" +
			"and an analyst with a different point of view";
		
		$(ilmente).html(iam);
	})(jQuery, alessandroBellini);
