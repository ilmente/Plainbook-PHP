# web and frontend developer
You can find out more detailed informations about my work on linkedinand on my online CV.
I began as an asp.net developer in 2005, almost on backend systems. After a while, I started my adventure as a freelance, designing web sites. This experience taught me a few things:

- windows systems cost a lot;
- open source community is made up of good guys;
- wordpress covered the 70% of my customers needs;
- photoshop is a designer-best-friend-forever;
- I do love client-side coding.


I decided to learn php a little bit more and I totally discoveredjquery and ajax potential, expecially if mixed with html5 and css3. I've never been a pure art director, and I never will, but I developed my passion for ui and ux studying client-side technologies.
Now I'm using the experience achieved in these years also developing mobile hybrid apps with phonegap/meap platforms.  At least, I am:

- a web developer of kindly web services and advanced javascript web apps;
- a frontend developer with a huge curiosity for design and usability;
- a mobile hybrid apps developer who loves minimal, elegant and functional interfaces;
- a student of organizational behaviours;
- an analyst with a different (↑) point of view.
