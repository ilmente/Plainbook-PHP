Hi everyone! My name is Alessandro and I'm a web and frontend developer.  This is my minimal site, with apparently nothing that shows what I do and how. Apparently.


In fact: this site runs on a debian 7.0 virtual machine with nginxhttp server. There's a mysql server too. This environment is used as a test/staging platform for my personal projects.  Pages you're navigating through are written in html5 (main structure) andcss3 (animations and layout - that is responsive too) compiled with {less}; javascript is also used to implement client navigation. Which technologies?jquery with underscore and backbone, all asynchronously loaded withrequire.js: I know, it's like having a Ferrari engine on a bicycle...BROOM!
All that remains on this site are words, but there's a secret! You can watch them appear, be written or casually sparkle on your screen. We always need a little bit of magic... ;)
