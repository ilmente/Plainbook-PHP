# alessandro bellini
ilmente, in english, can be literally transated with "the mind". For this reason, sometimes people asks me if I choosed this nickname because of my presumed (???) intelligence: nothing farthest from reality. ilmentestays for il mentecatto, and it means "the fool". Some friends of mine gave me that nickname when I was 14 because I used to act like a buffoon, especially with girls. Well... I still do it.
Having said that, let me introduce myself: Alessandro Bellini, eclectic fool since 1986. I'm a geek who loves fiddling with code, cooking and eating, singing out loud (even in my office, when alone) and playing bass guitar, dancing like a fool, watching great animes, reading newspapers, having ideas and knowing what I'm speaking about, travelling, matching with people, discovering new things and being happy.
